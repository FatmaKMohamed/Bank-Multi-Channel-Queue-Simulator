# Bank-Multi-Channel-Queue-Simulator

## Problem statement
A bank has one teller who can serve customers. Customers are divided into two types, 
ordinary and distinguished customers, where each type has a separate queue. The time 
between arrivals and the service time for the ordinary customers are as shown in table 1, 
while the time between arrivals and the service time for the distinguished customers are 
as shown in table 2. The distinguished customers have a higher priority to be served, 
i.e., a waiting distinguished customer will be served before a waiting ordinary customer. 
However, the service of an ordinary customer cannot be interrupted by the arrival of an 
distinguished customer.

## requirements
* The average service time of the teller.
* The average waiting time in the ordinary customers queue and the distinguished customers queue.
* The maximum ordinary customers queue length and the distinguished customers queue length.
* The probability that an ordinary customer wait in the queue, and the probability that a distinguished customer wait in the queue.
* The portion of idle time of the teller.

Moreover, the policy maker requires answers for the following questions:
* Does the theoretical average service time of the service time distribution match with the experimental one for both types of customers?
* Does the theoretical average inter-arrival time of the inter-arrival time distribution match with the experimental one for both types of customers?
* If there is an additional teller to serve the distinguished customers only, how does this affect the average waiting time in the queues of both types of 
customers?
